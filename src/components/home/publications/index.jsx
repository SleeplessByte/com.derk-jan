						Humans have a remarkable quality over all other species. We have the ability to inflict fear upon ourselves. When we're young, most of us are afraid
						of the things that live under our beds, but as we grow up we usually stop being scared as we know that there's nothing hiding. It's Ignorance that feeds
						our fears and the things we do not understand are almost instinctively seen as dangerous or scary. We try to find the knowledge to get out of the dark
						so we can stop fearing the unknown. But once we get to the light, it can be very lonely.

						Over the past few days there has been a lot of questions around the network configurations of Retroshare, an application that provides secure
						Friend-To-Friend (F2F) networks. There is not a lot of humanly readable documentation on the matter. I’ve been a Retroshare user for over 14 months at
						the time of writing and wrote this article as a part of a series on retroshare. In this article I’ll explain each of the four network configurations and
						their consequences.

						These days we share a lot of both public and private bits and bytes, and when that data is somewhat private, whether it is music, books, images, financial
						data or a simple conversation, we usually don’t like people  tapping in or logging that we are sharing and maybe more importantly what we are sharing.
					</CardText>
					<CardText style={{ lineHeight: '1.5' }}>
						The channels we use today make it so much easier to distribute anything we want, sadly resulting in a lot of illegal activity, which in turn is increasing both
						the means of copyright protection and the quality and quantity of monitoring data streams. So these channels have their downsides, such as their weaknes-ses when
						it comes to obscuring the act and the data itself or the pollution of fake fi les by agencies that try to stop our happy sharing activities.
